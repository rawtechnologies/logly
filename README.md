import { Logly } from 'logly';

});
```
(Mock example)

#### Enable cylde to make suggestions

- Add feed.js source to your repo
- Add Clyde as a contributor

#### How it works

Adding the feed.js script allows for it to intercept all errors that are generated on the client.
These logs are forwarded to a central server which also has a copy of the repo's source code on file.
Using the error and filename, the source code of the offending file is located and obtained.
Now with the required pieces:
- LLM prompt is created
- LLM response is generated
- Code is extracted and updated
- Git operations are performed
- GitHub operations are performed
